</h1>

<h6 align="center">
    Dead Simple Game Engine
</h6>

> [!WARNING] 
> DSGE is still in developement, not many functions in DSGE is included and sometimes can take hours to implement just for a single function, you may also experience bugs from DSGE and i'm working hard to fix any bugs before pushing to release!

#### What is this?
It's yet another 3DS Library made using C++, it's mission is to make DSGE a whole lot easier to make games for the 3DS System.

It's current working features are:
- Playing sounds.
- Customizable Text and Sprite.
- Tweening and Easing
- Timer stuff
- Lotta extra stuff.

#### Installation
Currently there's 1 way to install DSGE.

But first, please install devkitPro first, this is required for so many things (https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

Upon finishing the installation for devkitPro, you can start with DSGE installation

##### 1. From GitHub
1. Click on this: https://github.com/NAEL2XD/DSGE/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
2. Wait until it's finished downloading.
3. Open the downloaded output, (eg: The downloads folder)
4. Extract and open the downloaded directory.
5. Assuming you have Python installed, in the directory location, press and type `cmd`.
6. *(OPTIONAL, YOU CAN USE EXAMPLES/TEMPLATE, skip to step 8)* In the CLI, type `python template.py`, it should generate a template folder to set up.
7. *(OPTIONAL)* Go to the `template` folder
8. Double click on `run.bat` file and if everything should be working it should 1. launch output.3dsx by any of the emulators, or 2. it should be in the `build` and `3dsxbackups` folder..

> [!NOTE] 
> If you noticed the 3DSX file size being larger when that library is placed, it's because of so many things to implement in a single file (lotta functions from libctru/citro2d), this is normal.
